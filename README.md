# SpriteEditor
A simple web-based visual editor for making sprites intended to be used with [OpenVPet](https://github.com/VirtualDino/OpenVPet).

Features:
* Can make 16x16 or 32x32 size black and white sprites.
* Can import sprites from the clipboard or from txt files.
* Can copy sprites to the clipboard, or can export as a txt file.
* You can add multiple sprites to create a full sprite sheet, and there is support to rearrange sprites in the sheet or remove unnecessary sprites.
* You can export a preview image in PNG format.

Usage instructions:
It is rather straightforward to use. Click on the squares in the grid to toggle them between black or white. All of the control buttons do exactly as they are labeled.

I developed this tool in order to use it for the development of OpenVPet, so it only does what is needed for that project. I may come back to this in the future and expand upon the features of this tool and apply more CSS to make it visually pleasing. But for now, it's just a tool for development of my other project.
